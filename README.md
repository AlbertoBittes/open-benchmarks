# open-benchmarks

The objective of this repository is to compile
transport code input files, reference output,
and associated experimental data, adopting a systematic
directory structure to facilitate interfacing V&V systems
with it.

This repository is not visible to the public for the time
being. We can make it public once we have reached a certain
degree of completion and utility.

Please go ahead and implement your ideas/data structures.
Once we have collected some material, we can refactor
(if necessary) and discuss further steps.

## Description of contents
- [jade_open_benchmarks](./jade_open_benchmarks) contains all template inputs of the benchmarks that are freely distributed and that can be used in [JADE](https://jade-a-nuclear-data-libraries-vv-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). A complete description of the benchmarks can be found in the [specific JADE documentation seciton](https://jade-a-nuclear-data-libraries-vv-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/benchmarks.html). Additional details on how the repo is structured and how to upload modify the inputs is provided [here](./jade_open_benchmarks/jade_benchmarks.md).
