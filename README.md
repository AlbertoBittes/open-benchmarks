# open-benchmarks

The objective of this repository is to compile
transport code input files, reference output,
and associated experimental data, adopting a systematic
directory structure to facilitate interfacing V&V systems
with it.

This repository is not visible to the public for the time
being. We can make it public once we have reached a certain
degree of completion and utility.

Please go ahead and implement your ideas/data structures.
Once we have collected some material, we can refactor
(if necessary) and discuss further steps.
